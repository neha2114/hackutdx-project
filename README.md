DON'T work on the main branch. Make a new branch using the instructions below:
On the main branch, in the terminal:
1- git fetch origin
2- git reset --hard origin
2- git pull
3- git status
4- git checkout -b feature/"name of update"

Great! Now you're on your branch
Then do
git add .
git commit -m "describe what you changed"
git push
(might need to do the git upstream thing)

Then go to the github website and make a pull request. Might have merge conflicts, just lmk
